  description: %{ Stage a Scala distribution on sonatype using scripts/job/bootstrap.
    It builds locker and uses it to build and publish the required modules as well as the
    Scala compiler/library for this release, and generates an updated versions.properties
    that captures the modules/STARR used.

    <p> This job is run on every merge to publish a "nightly" snapshot, and on every tag, to stage a full release on sonatype.

    <p> Use github.com/scala/make-release-notes to build the release notes.
