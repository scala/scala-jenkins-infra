# Maintenance

## Checking status

Pointing your browser to https://manage.chef.io and logging in will
take you to https://manage.chef.io/organizations/typesafe-scala/nodes
which shows node names, IP addresses, uptimes, etc.

It also shows when each node last checked for updated cookbooks ("Last Check-In").

## ssh access

For troubleshooting Jenkins in particular it's often to helpful to ssh
in to the worker nodes and poke around the workspaces, see what
processes are running, that kind of thing. (See [setup instructions](client-setup.md#hosts-and-ssh-config).)

## Monitoring disk space

We should always have at least 10G or so free on all nodes.  A member
of the Scala team should check the free disk space numbers on all
nodes about every 3 to 4 days.  (Better yet, automate it.  And if
there is a chronic space problem, address the cause.)

A quick way to keep an eye on disk space is by visiting
https://scala-ci.typesafe.com/computer/.  You'll need to launch
any offline nodes in order to get a disk space number.

All of the nodes have a tendency to gradually run out of space, and
it's also possible to have a temporary space issue, e.g. if a
community build is run on a lot of different Scala versions.

Tips for addressing gradually dwindling free space:

* on the publish nodes (windows and ubuntu), the usual culprit is
  `/home/jenkins/tmp`.  ssh in and just blow away everything in there
  (but not while a job is running!).
* on jenkins-master, the culprit may vary.  Usually the problem
  is under `/var/lib/jenkins`. Poke around with commands like
  `find` and `du` and see where the space is going.  If you can't
  find anything else to delete, you can delete some old builds
  (`jobs/*/builds`) that we're unlikely to need to refer to again
  (e.g. really old `integrate-ide` runs, old `community-build` runs...)
  (A frequent culprit prior to fall 2016 was multi-gigabyte log
  files generated by failed PR validation jobs, but we think
  this was fixed by https://github.com/scala/scala-jenkins-infra/pull/183.)

Tips for addressing a temporary free-space issue on the behemoths:

* Usually the problem is in `/home/jenkins`.
* You can use the "Clear Workspace" button in the Jenkins UI.
* Alternatively, on the command line, in `/home/jenkins/workspace`,
  you can blow away `*/{dbuild,clones,target}-*`.  (Not while a
  community build job is running!)
* From time to time we can delete `~/.dbuild`, `~/.ivy2`, `~/.m2`

## Updating the scala-jenkins-infra cookbook

Note that the setup instructions don't require you to clone all of the
cookbooks to your local machine, only the scala-jenkins-infra
cookbook.  That's because our own cookbook is the one we usually
update; the rest don't normally need to be touched.

If you change the scala-jenkins-infra cookbook, you don't need
to push your change anywhere in order to test it in production.
We often test changes that way, and then after verifying that
the change is working as desired in production, we push the change
to scala/scala-jenkins-infra.

To make changes,

### 1. Edit the cookbook

Edit the cookbook.  (For example, a common change is to edit
one of the `.xml.erb` files for Jenkins.)

### 2. Upload the cookbook

    knife cookbook upload scala-jenkins-infra

This always uploads the cookbook to the Typesafe account on chef.io,
regardless of whether you made changes.

### 3. Run chef-client

Run `chef-client` on the affected nodes (usually jenkins-master),
which will cause the node to get the updated cookbook from chef.io.
You can run it automatically or manually.

Running it automatically just involves waiting.  On a regular schedule
(every 15 minutes, 30 minutes, something like that? it's configured in
our cookbook for chef-client itself), an already running chef-client
process will wake up and check chef.io for updates.  (The log for
the run presumably goes somewhere, but where? See
https://github.com/scala/scala-jenkins-infra/issues/110.)

But it's usually better to do it manually because you can watch it
happen and catch mistakes.  Any cookbook changes found will show up as
light-gray diffs in the `chef-client` output so you can spot and
sanity-check them.  If diffs are found, the cookbook specifies what
should happen as a result -- for example, that service might be
restarted.

The commands to run chef-client depend on whether the node in question
is Linux or Windows:

#### Linux node

Here `hostname` might be e.g. `jenkins-master` and username can be omitted
to accept the default in your `~/.ssh/config`, or can be explicitly supplied
e.g. `ec2-user@jenkins-master`.

```
ssh hostname   # or username@hostname to override your ~/.ssh/config default
sudo su --login # --login needed on ubuntu to set SSL_CERT_FILE (it's done in /etc/profile.d)
chef-client
```

#### Windows node

```
PASS=$(aws ec2 get-password-data --instance-id i-0485455cc766c86ef --priv-launch-key ~/.ssh/typesafe-scala-aws-$AWS_USER.pem | jq .PasswordData | xargs echo)
knife winrm jenkins-worker-windows-publish chef-client -m -P $PASS
```

# Misc

The remainder of this document is just rough notes.

## Upload all cookbooks to chef server

```
knife cookbook upload --all
```

this has not been done since the initial install!

"Adriaan could also make a tarball" of his all-cookbooks setup
sometime, maybe.

## SSL cert
```
$ openssl genrsa -out scala-ci.key 2048
```
and

```
$ openssl req -new -out scala-ci.csr -key scala-ci.key -config ssl-certs/scalaci.openssl.cnf
```

Send CSR to SSL provider, receive scalaci.csr. Store scala-ci.key securely in vault master scala-ci-key (see above).

Incorporate the cert into an ssl chain for nginx:
```
(cd ssl-certs && cat 00\ -\ scala-ci.crt 01\ -\ COMODORSAOrganizationValidationSecureServerCA.crt 02\ -\ COMODORSAAddTrustCA.crt 03\ -\ AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt > ../files/default/scala-ci.crt)
```

For [forward secrecy](http://axiacore.com/blog/enable-perfect-forward-secrecy-nginx/):
```
openssl dhparam -out files/default/dhparam.pem 1024
```

Using 1024 bits (instead of 2048) for DH to be Java 6 compatible... Bye-bye A+ on https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=scala-ci.typesafe.com

Confirm values in the csr using:

```
$ openssl req -text -noout -in scala-ci.csr
```

# Give up, bypass Chef?

When automating something Chef is too painful, we sometimes just make
a change manually.  This has obvious downsides:

* if the node needs to be recreated, we'll lose the manual change
* we could easily lose or forget about the manual change other
  ways, too

As a matter of policy, if you do anything manually, please add
an entry to
https://github.com/scala/scala-jenkins-infra/blob/master/automationPending.md
that explains what you did, when, and why.

# Troubleshooting

## Worker offline?

From the [list of nodes](https://scala-ci.typesafe.com/computer/),
you can click the entry for the node you're interested in and
from there, use the "Log" action on the left to see if the node
is in the process of coming online, and if so, watch it happen.

It takes a few minutes for ec2-start-stop to spin up a worker.

You can manually bring a node online by pressing the "Launch slave
agent" button.

## Worker goes offline during manual testing?

If you ssh in to a worker to poke around, that won't prevent Jenkins
from taking the worker offline if it is otherwise idle.  This can get
annoying.

The only we way know of to force the node to stay up is, ironically,
to use the node's "Mark this node temporarily offline" button.  This
tells Jenkins not to start any jobs on the node, but it also prevents
the node from being idled.  Don't forget to press "Bring this node
back online" when you're done.

## "ERROR: null" in slave agent launch log
There are probably multiple instances with the same name on EC2: https://github.com/lightbend/ec2-start-stop/issues/4
Workaround: make sure EC2 instance names are unique.

## Retry bootstrap

```
knife bootstrap -c $PWD/.chef/knife.rb jenkins-worker-ubuntu-publish --ssh-user ubuntu --sudo -c $PWD/.chef/knife.rb -N jenkins-worker-ubuntu-publish -r "scala-jenkins-infra::worker-init"
```

## Need chara access?

If something in the publishing process that talks to chara.epfl.ch is
failing, you might want to ssh to chara to troubleshoot.  The Linux
publisher node has the necessary ssh private key, so you can do first
ssh to jenkins-worker-ubuntu-publish, then from there do:

     ssh -i /home/jenkins/.ssh/jenkins_lightbend_chara scalatest@chara.epfl.ch

If you need more access to chara than that, contact Fabien Salvi
at EPFL.

## WinRM troubles?

You may wish to consult [Amazon's doc on WinRM+EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html).

To verify that you have Windows connectivity:

* make sure `jenkins-worker-windows-publish` is online; you can bring it
  online by logging into Jenkins and pressing the "Launch slave agent"
  button at https://scala-ci.typesafe.com/computer/jenkins-worker-windows-publish/

If connections hang, make sure:

* security group allows access to your IP
    * unless you happen to be at an already-whitelisted location (the Lightbend office in SF, perhaps?) you must specifically whitelist your IP address or a range of IP addresses, in the "Windows" security group in the AWS Console, for incoming access to port 3389 (RDP))
* WinRM was enabled using `--user-data`
* ...?

If it appears stuck at "Waiting for remote response before bootstrap.", the userdata didn't make it across
(check `C:\Program Files\Amazon\Ec2ConfigService\Logs`), so we need to enable unencrypted authentication:

```
aws ec2 get-password-data --instance-id $INST --priv-launch-key ~/.ssh/typesafe-scala-aws-$AWS_USER.pem

cord $IP  # log in using password above, open a command line, and do:

  winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}
  winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}

knife bootstrap -V windows winrm $IP
```

random CoRD tips:

* right-click is shift-control-click

## Cygwin troubles?

**symptom:** `'\r': command not found`

**solution:**: you're running a shell script that has Windows line endings.
check the script out from version control with `eol=lf`.  (you could
also do `export SHELLOPTS; set -o igncr` to tell bash to ignore
the extra carriage return characters, but it's better to address
the cause.)

**symptom:** stuff is broken

**solution:** it may be worth consulting the various notes in the
comments in [issue #36](https://github.com/scala/scala-jenkins-infra/issues/36),
some of which will probably end up in this doc
